                <p>Ben Sock: I love Make'n Model products because they last forever! This company really knows how 
                    to build things that last! My son does not have the best fine motor skills so I was worried 
                    that the cars would be difficult for him to build, but he had so much fun playing with
                    the pieces and I got to help him with the more challenging parts. After it was built, 
                    he played with the finished car for HOURS and LOVED every bit! Will be purchasing again!

                <p>Mathew Balm: My daughter just turned 5 this year and recieved a the Make 'n Model Vespa for her birthday. 
                     She is obessed with anything car related so this really was entertained for hours. All of 
                     her toys tend to break after a few months of use, but her Vespa still works as new. She 
                     really loves her toy and I love that she gets to explore her creativity.

                    Barbara Pants: I bought the Mclaren for my niece, and it turned out to be perfect for an aspiring engineer!
                    The assembly was wasn't too hard, and she had a blast putting it together with her friends.
                    The best part is that it's not just a one-time activity - she can take it apart and rebuild it 
                    over and over again. The quality is fantastic, and it provides hours of imaginative play. 
                    Highly recommended!
